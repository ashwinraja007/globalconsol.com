                Warehouse management plays a crucial role in the overall supply chain, focusing on controlling the
                movement and storage of materials within a warehouse. It encompasses various essential tasks such as
                shipping, receiving, put away, and picking, while also providing visibility into the processes preceding
                and following the supply chain link. By optimizing warehouse operations, your facility can become a
                catalyst for enhanced profitability and customer satisfaction, rather than an obstacle.
